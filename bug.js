In Next.js, an uncommon error arises when using server-side props (getServerSideProps) or static site generation (getStaticProps) with dynamic routes containing a wildcard. If the wildcard isn't handled correctly, the application might try to fetch data for a route that doesn't exist. This frequently results in runtime errors that are difficult to diagnose, especially if the API returns a 404 or an unexpected response. This often goes unnoticed in local development because of the development environment's default behavior. For example, if your route is `/product/[productId]`, a missing `productId` would cause an issue.
